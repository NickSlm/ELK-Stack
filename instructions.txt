INITIAL SETUP

1. Generate the configuration file using the programm(You can add hosts manually or using a list of hosts).
2. The programm will generate 4 files:
    * ".env" - environment variables.
    * "create-certs.yml" - service which creates certificates for all the hosts.
    * "instances.yml" - all the hosts for which we create certificates.
    * "docker-compose.yml" - docker-compose file which configures all the ELK nodes.
3. To generate all the certificates run the command - "docker-compose -f create-certs.yml --rm create_certs"
4. Run the docker-compose.yml using the command - "docker-compose up -d"
5. Make sure all the nodes are running(Keep in mind that kibana CANNOT access elasticsearch nodes at this point).
6. To configure kibana run the following command on one of the elasticsearch nodes:
    * Using docker:
        * linux - docker exec es01 /bin/bash -c "bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto --batch --url https://<nodename>:9200"
        * windows - docker exec es01 //bin/bash -c "bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto --batch --url https://<nodename>:9200"
    * Using one of the elasticsearch nodes cli - "bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto"
7. Once you run the command elasticsearch will generate a list of users and passwords SAVE THEM.
8. In docker-compose.yml under kibana node change ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD to the password generated under kibana_system.
9. Restart your ELK cluster:
    1. "docker-compose stop"
    2. "docker-compose up -d"
10. Access kibana using your browser, REMEMBER to use HTTPS.
11. Login using the password generated under elastic at step 7.
